# SimpleClientServer
Simple application client/server in WForm

## Objective
Create a simple application that connect into a distant server
With ip and two non-used port
Using simple functions
Respectful of conventions of the book "Coder Proprement" by Robert C. Martin

### Careful
#1 You need to be in the same network !
#2 You'll use two port (by default 1000 and 1001)
One is for you and one is for your server
 -> need to be coordinated
